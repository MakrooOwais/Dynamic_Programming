# countConstruct with Memoization - Optimized Approach

The `countConstruct` function has been optimized using a recursive approach with memoization. Memoization helps store previously calculated results for specific inputs to avoid redundant computations and improve the overall performance of the function.

## Function Description

The `countConstruct` function takes three inputs: the `target` string, a list of words `wordBank`, and an optional `memo` dictionary to store intermediate results.

## Recursive Approach with Memoization

1. If the `target` string is found in the `memo` dictionary, the function returns the result associated with that `target` without further calculations. This helps prevent redundant computations and significantly improves performance for repeated subproblems.

2. If the `target` string is empty, it means there is one way to construct the string (by using no words from the `wordBank`), and the function returns `1`.

3. The function initializes a variable `totalCount` to keep track of the total number of ways to construct the `target` string.

4. The function iterates through each word in the `wordBank`.

5. For each word, it checks if it matches the beginning of the `target` string. If so, it proceeds with the recursive call by removing the matched part from the `target` string.

6. The function then calls itself recursively with the modified `target`, the same `wordBank`, and the `memo` dictionary to count the number of ways to construct the remaining part of the `target` string.

7. The count of ways to construct the current `target` string is then updated by adding the number of ways found in the recursive call.

8. The function continues this process for all words in the `wordBank`, effectively exploring all possible combinations of words.

9. After exploring all combinations, the final `totalCount` is stored in the `memo` dictionary for the current `target` string to be reused later if needed.

10. The function returns the final `totalCount`, representing the number of ways to construct the `target` string.

## Usage

To use the `countConstruct` function, provide the `target` string and the list of words `wordBank`. Optionally, you can pass a `memo` dictionary to store intermediate results. The function will count the number of ways the `target` string can be constructed using words from the `wordBank`.

## Performance

With memoization, the `countConstruct` function significantly improves performance compared to the previous recursive implementation. By avoiding redundant computations, the function can handle larger inputs efficiently.

## Note

While memoization enhances the recursive approach, it is important to note that very long `target` strings and large `wordBank` lists can still lead to performance issues. For even greater optimization, consider exploring tabulation, which uses an iterative approach and can provide further performance improvements for complex problems.
