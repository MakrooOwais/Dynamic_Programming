# countConstruct Function - Recursive Approach

The `countConstruct` function counts the number of ways the `target` string can be constructed using words from the `wordBank`. It uses a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of words to construct the `target` string.

## Function Description

The `countConstruct` function takes two inputs: the `target` string and a list of words `wordBank`.

## Recursive Approach

1. If the `target` string is empty, it means there is one way to construct the string (by using no words from the `wordBank`), and the function returns `1`.

2. The function initializes a variable `totalCount` to keep track of the total number of ways to construct the `target` string.

3. The function iterates through each word in the `wordBank`.

4. For each word, it checks if it matches the beginning of the `target` string. If so, it proceeds with the recursive call by removing the matched part from the `target` string.

5. The function then calls itself recursively with the modified `target` and the same `wordBank` to count the number of ways to construct the remaining part of the `target` string.

6. The count of ways to construct the current `target` string is then updated by adding the number of ways found in the recursive call.

7. The function continues this process for all words in the `wordBank`, effectively exploring all possible combinations of words.

8. After exploring all combinations, the function returns the final `totalCount`, representing the number of ways to construct the `target` string.

## Usage

To use the `countConstruct` function, provide the `target` string and the list of words `wordBank`. The function will count the number of ways the `target` string can be constructed using words from the `wordBank`.

## Performance

The recursive approach implemented by the `countConstruct` function can be inefficient for larger inputs, especially when there are many recursive calls with overlapping subproblems. As a result, the function may take a significant amount of time to execute for certain inputs.

## Note

While the recursive approach provides a simple way to count the number of ways to construct the `target` string, it is not the most efficient solution for all cases. To improve performance, consider exploring more advanced techniques like memoization or tabulation, which can optimize the solution by avoiding redundant computations and storing previously calculated results.
