# countConstruct with Tabulation - Optimized Approach

The `countConstruct` function has been optimized using a tabulation approach. Tabulation is a bottom-up technique that avoids recursion and solves subproblems in a systematic order, storing intermediate results in an array to build up the final solution.

## Function Description

The `countConstruct` function takes two inputs: the `target` string and a list of words `wordBank`.

## Tabulation Approach

1. The function initializes an array `result` of size `len(target) + 1` to keep track of the number of ways to construct the `target` string up to each index.

2. Since there is one way to construct an empty string (by not using any words), `result[0]` is set to 1.

3. The function iterates through each index `i` of the `target` string.

4. For each index `i`, it checks if `result[i]` is non-zero. If `result[i]` is not zero, it means there are some ways to construct the string up to index `i`.

5. The function then iterates through each word in the `wordBank`.

6. For each word, it checks if it matches the substring starting from index `i` and having the same length as the word.

7. If a match is found, it means we can construct the word at index `i`. So, the value at `result[i + len(word)]` is increased by the value at `result[i]`.

8. The process continues for all indices and words in the `wordBank`, effectively building up the number of ways to construct the `target` string.

9. After the loop, `result[len(target)]` contains the total number of ways to construct the entire `target` string.

10. The function returns the final `result[len(target)]`, representing the number of ways to construct the `target` string.

## Usage

To use the `countConstruct` function, provide the `target` string and the list of words `wordBank`. The function will count the number of ways the `target` string can be constructed using words from the `wordBank`.

## Performance

The tabulation approach implemented by the `countConstruct` function provides an efficient solution to the problem. By avoiding recursion and using an iterative approach, the function can handle large inputs with significant performance improvements.

## Note

Tabulation is particularly useful when the problem exhibits overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. In such cases, tabulation ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, and the results are stored for future use, leading to a more efficient solution.
