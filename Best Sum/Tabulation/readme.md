# The bestSum Problem with Tabulation - Optimized Approach

The `bestSum` function is an improved Python implementation that utilizes tabulation to solve the "Best Sum" problem efficiently. Tabulation is a dynamic programming technique that involves filling up a table (in this case, a list) with the results of subproblems to build up the final solution.

## Tabulation - Overview

In this implementation, instead of using recursive calls with memoization, the `bestSum` function utilizes a list called `result` to store the best combination of numbers for each possible target sum. The list is iteratively filled from the base case (`targetSum = 0`) to the desired `targetSum`.

## Function Description

The `bestSum` function now uses the following approach with tabulation:

1. Initialize the `result` list of length `targetSum + 1` with `None` values. `result[i]` will store the best combination for the `targetSum` of `i`. Additionally, set `result[0]` to an empty list `[]` since there is one way to achieve a target sum of 0, which is by not selecting any number.

2. Starting from `targetSum = 0`, iteratively fill the `result` list for each `targetSum` value up to the desired target sum.

3. For each `targetSum` value `i`, if the combination for `i` is not `None` (i.e., if there exists a combination to achieve the target sum of `i`), iterate through the `numbers` array.

4. For each number in the `numbers` array, calculate the potential new target sum (`i + number`).

5. If the new target sum is within the valid range (i.e., less than or equal to the desired target sum), check if the current combination for this new target sum is `None` or longer than the potential new combination (`[*result[i], number]`). If so, update the combination for this new target sum with the new, shorter combination.

6. Continue the process until all possible `targetSum` values are filled in the `result` list.

7. Return the combination for the desired `targetSum`, which is stored in `result[targetSum]`.

## Usage of Tabulation

The tabulation technique helps avoid the overhead of recursive function calls and memoization. Instead, it fills the `result` list iteratively, leading to a more efficient solution for the "Best Sum" problem.

## Usage

To use the `bestSum` function with tabulation, provide the `targetSum` and the `numbers` array as inputs. For example:

```python
inputs = [(7, [2, 3]), (7, [2, 4]), (7, [5, 3, 4, 7]), (8, [2, 3, 5]), (300, [7, 14])]

for input in inputs:
    result = bestSum(*input)
    print(f"bestSum{input} = {result}")
```

## Performance

The tabulation-based `bestSum` function provides an efficient solution to finding the smallest set of numbers from the `numbers` array that adds up to the `targetSum`. Its time complexity is greatly reduced compared to the recursive approach, making it well-suited for larger inputs.

By utilizing tabulation, the `bestSum` function offers an efficient and optimized solution to the "Best Sum" problem. This approach leverages the `result` list to store the best combinations for each possible target sum, allowing for a significant reduction in execution time and overall improved performance.
