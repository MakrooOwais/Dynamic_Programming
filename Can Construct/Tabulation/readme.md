# The anConstruct Function with Tabulation - Optimized Approach

The `canConstruct` function has been further optimized using a tabulation approach, which uses a table to store intermediate results for subproblems. This method efficiently determines whether it is possible to construct the `target` string from a list of words in the `wordBank`.

## Function Description

The `canConstruct` function takes two inputs: the `target` string and a list of words `wordBank`.

## Tabulation Approach

1. The function initializes a boolean array called `result` of size `len(target) + 1`. Each element of the array represents a prefix of the `target` string, where `result[i]` indicates whether it is possible to construct the substring `target[0:i]`.

2. The base case is `result[0] = True`, indicating that an empty string can be constructed.

3. The function iterates through the `result` array from the beginning. For each `True` value encountered at index `i`, it means that the substring `target[0:i]` can be constructed.

4. For each word in the `wordBank`, the function checks if the word matches the current prefix of the `target` string (i.e., `target[i:i+len(word)]`). If there is a match, it means the word can be used to extend the current prefix.

5. If a match is found, the function sets `result[i + len(word)]` to `True`, indicating that the word can be used to construct the substring `target[0:i+len(word)]`.

6. The function continues this process for all prefixes of the `target` string, building the `result` array based on the available words in the `wordBank`.

7. After processing all prefixes, the final result is found in `result[len(target)]`, which indicates whether the entire `target` string can be constructed from words in the `wordBank`.

## Usage

To use the `canConstruct` function, provide the `target` string and the list of words `wordBank`. The function will determine if it is possible to construct the `target` string using words from the `wordBank`.

```python
inputs = [
    ("skateboard", ["bo", "rd", "ate", "t", "ska", "sk", "boar"]),
    ("", ["cat", "dog", "mouse"]),
    ("abcdef", ["ab", "abc", "cd", "def", "abcd"]),
    ("enterapotentpot", ["a", "p", "ent", "enter", "ot", "o", "t"]),
    (
        "eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeef",
        ["e", "eeeee", "eeeeeeeee", "eeeeeeeeeeeeeee"],
    ),
]

for input in inputs:
    result = canConstruct(*input)
    print(f"canConstruct{input} = {result}")

```

## Performance

The tabulation approach implemented by the `canConstruct` function provides optimal performance, avoiding redundant computations and efficiently handling larger inputs. This makes it well-suited for solving complex problems that require determining the existence of combinations or patterns within strings or arrays.

## Note

While tabulation offers a highly efficient solution for this particular problem, it may not always be the most intuitive approach. Understanding the logic behind the tabulation table and the relationship between subproblems is crucial for successfully applying this technique to various dynamic programming challenges.
